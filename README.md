# PinUp Gallery â€“ VS Code Extension

A Visual Studio Code extension that lets you browse an image gallery inside the
sidebar, drag & drop images into the editor, and **pin** selected images into
their own persistent windows for quick access.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Gallery View**  
  Browse images stored in the extensionâ€™s `media/` folder, grouped by category.

- **Drag & Drop**  
  Drag an image directly into an editor tab to insert a Markdown snippet or a
  plain URI.

- **Pin Images**  
  Click a thumbnail to open a dedicated panel for that image.  
  Pinned panels are remembered across VS Code restarts.

- **Automatic Media Discovery**  
  Files inside the `media/` folder are grouped automatically by name prefix
  (`beauty_`, `senior_`, `true_`, etc.).  
  Add a file with the right prefix and it appears in the gallery next time the
  extension is activated.
